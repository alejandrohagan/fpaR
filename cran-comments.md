## Resubmission of an archived package

'ti' was archived on 2026-04-06 because the check ERRORs reported for version
4.0.0 were not corrected in time. This submission fixes them.

### Why 4.0.0 failed

All failures came from a single cause. 'ti' uses the 'contoso' package (Suggests)
for sample data in its tests and examples. 'contoso' 2.1.0 renamed the `margin`
column of its `sales` dataset to `gross_margin`, so every test that measured that
column failed with `Object 'margin' not found` (55 failures across
`test-retail-calendar.R` and `test-ti_fn.R`).

This is also why only some flavours reported ERROR: the macOS flavours, where
'contoso' was not installed, skipped the affected tests and returned OK.

### Fixes in this version

* All tests and examples now use `gross_margin`, matching 'contoso' >= 2.1.0.
  'contoso' is pinned to `(>= 2.1.0)` in Suggests so the mismatch cannot recur.
* Restored `calculate()` and `create_calendar()` to NAMESPACE. roxygen2 8.0.0
  added S7 support and no longer emits an export from `@export` on an
  `S7::method()<-` block, so both generics were silently dropped and every call
  failed with "'calculate' is not an exported object from 'namespace:ti'". The
  generics are now documented and exported on their `S7::new_generic()`
  definitions, following `vignette("rd-S7", package = "roxygen2")`.
* Removed the incorrect `export(print)` directive. S7 registers the `print()`
  methods at load time via `S7::methods_register()`, so re-exporting `base::print`
  was never needed.
* Documented all S7 classes, using `@prop` for read-only computed properties.
* Merged two roxygen blocks in `R/utils-misc.R` that had run together, which
  produced a malformed `@keywords` entry.

Version 4.2.0 was prepared with the first of these fixes but was never published;
4.2.1 is the version being submitted. See NEWS.md for the full list of changes
since 4.0.0.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

The NOTE is expected for this submission:

* "New submission" and "Package was archived on CRAN" — this resubmission is
  addressed above.
* "Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION: MTD, QTD, YTD, backends" — these
  are correct. MTD, QTD and YTD are the standard financial abbreviations for
  month-, quarter- and year-to-date, and "backends" is the usual spelling for
  database backends.

## Test environments

* local: Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS, R 4.6.1

Checked with `devtools::check(remote = TRUE, manual = TRUE)`. Tests were run
against 'contoso' 2.1.0, the version currently on CRAN, as well as 2.2.0.
